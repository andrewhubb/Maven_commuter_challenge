# Welcome to my Maven Commuter Challenge Repository

In this repository you will find the Jupyter notebooks and the app.py file for the 
dash app that I have created along with supporting files.

I have included the data files in a subfolder in this repository as I wanted to make it easier for
deployment. The files are available in the Maven Dataplayground at [Maven MTA Daily Ridership Dataset Download Link](https://maven-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MTA+Daily+Ridership/MTA+Daily+Ridership.zip)
